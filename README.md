Raspberry Pi control of Daikin air conditioner using infra-red and Ciseco xrf serial modules

# History
I needed to control my a/c remotely over the internet. I was inspired by http://www.instructables.com/id/Reverse-engineering-of-an-Air-Conditioning-control/ to reverse engineer the IR protocol. Thanks!!!!
I already had a Raspberry Pi with an [XRF module](https://www.wirelessthings.net/xrf-wireless-rf-radio-uart-serial-data-module-xbee-shaped) and I didn't want to use the send part of lirc so I decided to use another XRF module with a [PIC](http://www.microchip.com/).
